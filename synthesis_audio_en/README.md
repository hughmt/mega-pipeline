# Synthesis Audio

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ &rightarrow; ðŸ”Š

In this container, you will implement the following:
* Read the paragraphs of text from the GCS bucket `mega-pipeline-bucket` and folder `text_paragraphs`
* Use Cloud Text-to-Speech API to generate an audio file in English
* Save the audio mp3 file in bucket `mega-pipeline-bucket` and folder `text_audios` (use the same file name and change the extension to .mp3)


## Create a local secrets folder and add the GCP Credentials File:
It is important to note that we do not want any secure information in Git. So we will manage these files outside of the git folders. At the same level as the app folders create a folder called secrets

Your folder structure should look like this:

|-mega-pipeline<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  |-transcribe_audio<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; |-generate_text<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; |-synthesis_audio_en<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; |-translate_text<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  |-synthesis_audio<br>
|-secrets

Download the json file and place inside the secrets folder:
